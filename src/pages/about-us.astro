			<h2>Welcome to Rosi Peruvian Buffet </h2>
			<p>
				Located in the heart of Orlando, Rosi Peruvian Catering brings the bold, authentic flavors of Peru straight to your table. Whether you're planning a family gathering, corporate event, or simply craving homemade Peruvian food, we’re here to make your meal unforgettable.

			<h3> 👩‍🍳 Our Story</h3>
			<p>
				Founded by Rosa, a passionate home cook and proud Peruvian, our catering service began as a family dream. With recipes passed down from her mother and grandmother, Rosa turned her love for cooking into a service that now feeds families, friends, and entire events across Orlando.

				Every tamale, every chicharrón, and every plate of arroz con pollo is made from scratch — just like it’s done back home.
			</p>

			<h3> 💖 Our Philosophy</h3>
			<blockquote>"Sabor peruano hecho en casa — con amor"</blockquote>
			<p>
				At Rosi Peruvian Catering, we believe great food comes from the heart. That’s why we use traditional ingredients, cook with care, and treat every client like family. Whether it’s a full buffet or a lunch order, every bite reflects Rosa’s heritage and hospitality.
